            As social development produces both new possibilities and fresh
            challenges, active attempts to establish a better future for
            monitoring, assessment, and learning will become increasingly more
            crucial in the coming years. These changes in the philanthropic
            landscape—and the world around it—are profoundly altering the
            backdrop for decision-making inside social sector organizations as
            well as the larger practice of monitoring, evaluation, and learning.
